# Data Validator Library in Your Preferred Language

### Objective
Build a robust validation library in your preferred programming language (JavaScript, Python, Java, etc.) that can validate complex data structures leveraging Cursor IDE's capabilities.

### Setup

Start with this basic template that you can adapt to your language of choice: (Example)[https://github.com/julia-dream/ai-data-validator/blob/master/schema.js].

### Task Instructions

Core Validator Functions:
- Create type-safe validator functions for primitive types
- Implement validators for complex types (arrays, objects)
- Design validators according to your language's type system and best practices
Composition System:
- Create functions to combine validators (and, or, optional)
- Ensure validators can be composed to validate complex data structures
- Build a system that maintains type information when applicable
Schema Builder
- Implement an API for building validation schemas
- Create a Result type to handle validation outcomes
- Design a clean interface for defining validation rules

### Implementation and Testing
- Build your solution in your preferred language
- Create examples demonstrating validation of complex data structures
- Test your library with various data patterns

### Deliverables
1. Implementation in Your Language of Choice
Complete the validation library using your preferred programming language. Your implementation should include:
- Primitive type validators
- Composition functions
- Schema builder
- Result handling
2. Documentation
Provide brief documentation explaining:
- How to use your validator library
- How to create custom validators
- How to compose validators
- How schema validation works in your implementation
Complete this task using Cursor IDE with your preferred language. Focus on building a clean, type-safe validation library that follows good practices for your chosen language.
