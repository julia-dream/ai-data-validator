# Data Validator Library in Your Preferred Language

### AI Technique: AI-Assisted Development with Cursor IDE

Cursor IDE integrates advanced AI models directly into the coding workflow, providing real-time code suggestions, refactoring assistance, and context-aware documentation. This approach streamlines development, reduces boilerplate, and helps maintain best practices throughout the project.
Key benefits of using Cursor IDE for this task:
- AI-Powered Code Generation: Participants can describe desired functionality in natural language, and Cursor will generate type-safe, idiomatic code snippets, validator functions, and schema builders.
- Contextual Refactoring: The AI can suggest improvements, refactor code for clarity or performance, and ensure adherence to the project’s style guide.
- Instant Documentation: Cursor can generate and update documentation blocks, usage examples, and API references as the code evolves.
- Error Detection and Fixes: The AI highlights potential bugs or type mismatches and proposes fixes, reducing debugging time.
- Seamless Testing: Participants can ask Cursor to generate test cases for various data patterns, ensuring comprehensive validation coverage.
By leveraging these AI capabilities, participants can focus on designing clean, maintainable validation logic while offloading repetitive or boilerplate tasks to the AI. This results in a more efficient workflow and higher-quality code.

### Task
Build a robust validation library in your preferred programming language (JavaScript, Python, Java, etc.) that can validate complex data structures leveraging Cursor IDE's capabilities.

### Setup

Start with this basic template that you can adapt to your language of choice: (Example)[https://github.com/julia-dream/ai-data-validator/blob/master/schema.js].

### Task Instructions

1. Set Up Your Project in Cursor IDE
  - Open Cursor IDE and create a new project in your preferred programming language (TypeScript, Python, Java, etc.). Use Cursor’s AI features to scaffold your project structure and initialize your workspace.
2. Implement Core Validator Functions
  - Use Cursor’s AI to help you write type-safe validator functions for primitive types (e.g., string, number, boolean).
  - Extend your library to support complex types such as arrays and objects.
  - Ensure your validators follow your language’s best practices and type system.
3. Design a Composition System
  - Build functions to combine validators (e.g., and, or, optional).
  - Use Cursor’s AI to suggest and implement composable patterns for complex data structures.
  - Maintain type information throughout your composition system.
4. Create a Schema Builder API
  - Implement an intuitive API for defining validation schemas.
  - Introduce a Result type or similar construct to handle validation outcomes.
  - Use Cursor’s AI to generate clean, readable interfaces for schema definition and validation rules.
5. Leverage AI for Documentation and Refactoring
  - Use Cursor’s AI to generate inline documentation and usage examples.
  - Refactor your code with AI suggestions to ensure clarity, maintainability, and adherence to your style guide.

## Implementation and Testing

- Build Your Solution in Cursor IDE
  - Develop your validation library using Cursor’s AI-powered code generation and refactoring tools. Take advantage of AI suggestions to optimize your implementation and maintain type safety.
- Demonstrate Complex Validation 
  - Create example schemas and validators that handle nested and complex data structures. Use Cursor’s AI to help generate and validate these examples.
- Test with Diverse Data Patterns
  - Write comprehensive test cases covering valid and invalid data scenarios. Use Cursor’s AI to generate and expand your test suite, ensuring robust validation coverage.

## Deliverables

1. **Validation Library Implementation**  
   - Complete, type-safe validator functions for primitive and complex types  
   - Composition functions for combining validators  
   - Schema builder API and result handling logic

2. **Documentation**  
   - Clear instructions on how to use your validator library  
   - Examples of creating and composing custom validators  
   - Guidance on schema validation and result interpretation  
   - All documentation generated or refined with Cursor’s AI tools

3. **Test Suite**  
   - A set of test cases demonstrating validation of various data structures  
   - Tests for both successful and failing validation scenarios  
   - Tests generated or expanded using Cursor’s AI capabilities

**Note:**  
All development, documentation, and testing should be performed within Cursor IDE, leveraging its AI features to maximize productivity and code quality.
